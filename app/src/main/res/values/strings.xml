  <string name="petInfo">The content of this page is encrypted. Only because you passed the correct password, key could be fetched and decryption could be done.Encryption is done by AES key.A function called Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF2) comes to the rescue. It takes a password and, by hashing it with random data many times over, it creates a key. The random data is called salt. This creates a strong and unique key, even if someone else uses the same password. </string>
